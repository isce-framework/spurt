|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| $\psi_{x}^{i}$           | Wrapped phase at pixel $x$ in SLC $i$ |
| $\psi_{x}^{ij}$          | Wrapped phase at pixel $x$ in interferogram $ij$                 |
| $\phi_{x}^{ij}$          | Unwrapped phase at pixel $x$ in interferogram $ij$                 |
| $\Delta \psi_{xy} ^{ij}$ |Double difference wrapped phase between pixels $x$ and $y$ in interferogram $ij$|
| $\Delta \phi_{xy}^{ij}$ | Double difference unwrapped phase between pixels $x$ and $y$ in interferogram $ij$|


Wrapped phases are assumed to be in the range $\left[ -\pi, \pi \right)$.
When working with phase linked data, the phase data in inherently referenced to a particular acquisition in the stack.
